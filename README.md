# Lakeside Web Development

The official "coming soon" website for Lakeside Web Devleopment

## Purpose of this Repo

The reason that we made this repo is because of the fact that we believe in being open-source and honest with our clients, so, anything that we create _(for Lakeside)_ is publically available for the community to either take a look at, or maybe even contribute to it!

## Contributing to the project

It's super simple to make your own changes to the website! All you have to do is the following:

1. Clone this repo
2. Make your edits
3. "Checkout" your edits
4. Open a PR _(pull request)_!

It's that easy!

If you ever have any issues, and don't know how to code or make any technical edits, we strongly encourage that you join our Community Discord OR you can open an issue on this Github repo.

We will not offer support if you do not know what you are doing.
